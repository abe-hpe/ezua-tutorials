    "This exercise will be introduce **EzPresto**, HPE Ezmeral's supercharged Presto distribution on **HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics**. EzPresto is an SQL query engine based on the open-source query engine PrestoDB that is optimized to run federated queries across various data sources. Enterprise applications and data processing engines (such as Spark!) can leverage EzPresto for rapid query performance and prompt insights through federated data access. \n",

    "- Connect Data Sources to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics.\n",
    "- Run SQL queries using the Unified Analytics Query Editor.\n",
    "- Learn about HPE's custom Jupyter Magic commands.\n",
    "- Run SQL queries on connected Data Sources directly from within a notebook cell.\n",
